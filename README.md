<h1>Network Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap</h1>


<h2>Project Details</h2>
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free, open-source tool used by cybersecurity professionals to scan networks and systems for vulnerabilities. It is designed to be easy to install and use in authorized environments for non-malicious purposes.
<br />
<br />

**Tasks Breakdown:**

**Task 1: Installing and Verifying Nmap Installation & Version**

Began by installing Nmap, ensuring it was set up correctly to function as needed, Also, verifying the installed version. This foundational step is crucial as it ensures that all subsequent scanning activities are performed on a stable and reliable platform.

**Task 2: Accessing the Help Feature and Man Page for Nmap**

Familiarized myself with the Nmap help feature and the manual page (man page). This is important for understanding the various commands and options available in Nmap, allowing for more effective use of the tool.

**Task 3: Running a Basic Nmap Scan on a Target**

Conducted a basic Nmap scan on an authorized target. This step is vital for identifying open ports and active services, which are points that could potentially be exploited by attackers. The scan helps in assessing the security posture of the network or system.

**Task 4: Running an Nmap Scan using Options**

To refine my scanning process, I utilized specific Nmap options to achieve more accurate results, faster scans, and customized outputs. This demonstrates an advanced understanding of Nmapâ€™s capabilities and how to tailor scans to meet specific needs.

**Task 5: Outputing Nmap Scan Results to a File**

Finally, I exported the results of my previous scans into a file. This is beneficial for documentation and detailed analysis, allowing for a thorough review of the vulnerabilities at a later time.

**Bonus Task: Running a Customized Scan on a Target**

This is an additional task that I wanted to add where I will be running a customized scan on a target and saving the results in a txt file for the Security Team to review in the next meeting. I will:<br />


- Perform an Nmap scan, scanning ports 22-80, on the target: scanme.nmap.org.

- Use the appropriate option to enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

- Set my scan to -T3 for the timing execution of the scan.

- Output the scan results to a txt file named: output.txt.

- Verify the contents of the output.txt file.

- Be sure to reference my Nmap man page for help.

<br />

**Key Takeaways:**

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in using Nmap for security assessments but also helped me in understanding how to methodically approach network scanning and vulnerability assessment. In Addition, Documenting each step and understanding the outcomes prepared me for real-world cybersecurity challenges and audits.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Terminal: Utilized for all command-line operations. The Terminal was the primary interface for executing Nmap scans and managing network assessments.</b> 
  

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Linux Desktop Environment: The project was conducted in a Linux-based environment. This setup incorporated several development and network analysis tools, though my work focused on utilizing the Terminal for all operations. This choice emphasizes a commitment to leveraging the powerful, versatile capabilities of Linux for network security tasks.</b>
